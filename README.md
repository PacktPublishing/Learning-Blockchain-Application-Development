# Learning Blockchain Application Development [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning Blockchain Application Development [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-blockchain-application-development-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789345728), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## Updates for Solidity 0.5.0 and Node.js v10
The code in this repo has been updated to work with Solidity v0.5.0 and Node.js v10. Where this caused differences in the code here and the code shown in the video, comments have made in the code explaining the difference (and why).

## About the Video Course
Blockchain disrupts many different aspects of our life including finance, retail, merchandising, identity, and more. Ethereum is a platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. This is the perfect guide to help you learn the basics of building decentralized applications with the Ethereum network. You’ll learn the core concepts of decentralized applications as we build an online marketplace, connecting buyers and sellers together to exchange goods and services. In doing so, you’ll deploy your code to the Ethereum network, and build a user Interface to expose your decentralized application to the world.

The focus of this course is learning blockchain and using it for application development by building applications, where each application should do something useful. You’ll learn how to create smart contracts, implement business logic using Solidity, and test your code. By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills necessary to build, test, and deploy applications in the Ethereum network. You’ll also have a solid understanding of blockchain application development, with skills that readily transfer to application development on other blockchains such as NEO, EOS, Cardano, and more.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is suitable for IT Professionals and Software Engineers at all levels seeking to learn Blockchain Application Development. No prerequisite skills in blockchain technology are required though some familiarity with writing code and applications will be helpful.
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
Minimum Hardware Requirements
For successful completion of this course, students will require the computer systems with at least the following:


OS: Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, Linux



Processor: Intel Core i5 or higher



Memory: 8 GB


There are two folders for the codes in this repo:

- _start_ contains the boilerplate code you'll need to follow along with the examples in the course. You'll add your own code as you go in order to build a fully functioning Marketplace. Any code not demonstrated in the course videos has already been completed in this folder.

- _final_ contains the fully functioning application demonstrated during this course. Use this to browse the code on your own, or as a reference if you get stuck writing your own code.
